# Hungry Animal (SomethingSomethingTwice Edition)
## How does it differ?
- New animations and overall cleanup of them
- Music
- An obstacle: a barrel!
    - It spawns from score 10 onwards and is ever so slightly faster than the apple
- Smoother movement!
    - SmoothMover is used, which allows for floating point accurate velocity
